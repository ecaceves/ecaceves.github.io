                <p>Project Description: I created a movie poster based off the short story "The Secret life of Walter Mitty". I wanted to incoporate a favorite actor of mine as the star role- Robin Williams! I used procreate to draw and color a half of Robin William's face. I kept one side in a cartoonish style and had the other half of his face in black and white, keeping the original realistic photo. I wanted to contrast the ordinary, mundane life of Walter Mitty and his escape to his wild imagination- where it's more colorful and full of adventure, as found in the short story. I used photoshop and adobe illustrator to merge my procreate doodle onto the image of Robin Williams, along with organizing and adding text for my poster- the title, caption, etc, and finally used photoshop and adobe illustrator to create a mountain background and add color.   </p>
