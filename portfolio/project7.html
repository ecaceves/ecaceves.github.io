                <p>Project Description: For this assignment I decided to challenge myself by selecting a circus as my landscape to animate. I primarily relied on Adobe Animate for this animation. At first I was troubled on how to approach this project- as my options were wide open. I browsed through Pinterest for inspiration and settled on a circus after discovering I could make vectors from this site in addition to using Photoshop. I kept a circus tent in the center and was able to make it zoom in and out. I animated balloons, a party streamer, stars, had a wavy background, and using characters from Pinterest- I made them my circus attractions. It was interesting to see these figures come to life- the unicycle, juggling clown, and trapeze act. I was able to make things move around and I was able to find music on Soundcloud for my animation's background- and I feel that really tied it all together :)   </p>
