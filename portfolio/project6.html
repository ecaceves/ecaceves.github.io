                <p>Project Description: In this assignment, our class was challenged to create a book cover with the help from a teammate by using AI. My partner and I settled on a dystopian genre. We started off by asking Chat Gpt to generate titles, a list of authors, along with a list of subtitles. It took a couple of tries to get the AI tool to genereate results that sounded the most realistic, but it was fascinating to see how quickly the AI tool was able to generate lists as we made suggestions. Before long, we settled for our dystopian book cover to be titled "Memory's Vanishing Labyrinth", written by "S.W. Asher", and its subtitle- "Unraveling the Secrets In A Forgotten World". Now that we were given basic information for a dystopian novel- I turned to Adobe firefly to create the book cover. I used the description to illustration tool to generate a protagonist venturing through an ominous, puzzling, and futuristic labyrinth. For my version of this story- a heroine joins forces with a secret rebellious group against a tyrannical government thaat controls its civilians by earsing their memories. The hero must venture through a labyrinth to recover the stolen memories, all the while danger lurks throughout the labyrinth's corridors- including the risk of getting her memories erased herself- by a powerful and menacing work of technology that erases memories. I learned for Generative AI- you want to be descriptive as you can and I was able to play around with the results I got and get different interpretations of what i'd written. I used Photoshop for my book cover layout- and even used the Generative AI tool on Photoshop to create the menacing robot with its piercing blue eye. I finally added a tech-like text and gave it a bright yellow color to give it a futuristic-feel.  I was really happy with the way that this book cover came out- it looks pretty convincing of a dystopian and futuristic journey.   </p>
