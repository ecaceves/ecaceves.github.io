                <p>Project Description: This video is a compilation of moments in my life throughout 2023. I wanted to reflect on the kinds of things I got to experience and who I got to share those experiences with. I used Premiere Pro to make transitions from month to month- I made cuts in between photo transitions and added captions. This was my very firsy time editing and creating a video. I was able to find background music I liked on Youtube and it directed me to SoundCloud to download. By taking a look at this short video I hope it reminds me and inspires others to look forward to a new year and feel excited for new memories waiting to be built and explored. </p>
