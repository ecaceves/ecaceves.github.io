                <p>Project Description: For this assignment, we were tasked with experimenting with sound design. From the clip options, I settled on the oone that began with an astronaut and transitioned into other dance scenes- it reminded me of a music video. Taking a look on Freesound.org and Soundcloud, I tried to find sounds or music that fit each scene that played out. I was able to find and incorporate throughout the clips a techno, robot, club song that stood out to me, a more slower melody, a laid-back, more chill vibe from another song, and ended my video with a happy piano beat. It was a great learning experience- while it may have not been my strong suit- it was interesting to see other tools availble like fading in, playing around with the volume of sound, and overall getting to edit another video. It started off as a silent clip and came to life a little.  </p>
